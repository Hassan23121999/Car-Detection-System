# Car-Detection-System
A car detection system using Haar cascade features for real-time vehicle detection. This project utilizes OpenCV and a Haar cascade classifier to detect cars in video files with high accuracy


# Car Detection System

## Project Description
This project provides a car detection system using Haar cascade features for real-time vehicle detection. The system uses OpenCV and a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier to detect cars in video files, marking them with bounding boxes. It offers a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting video files and displaying detection results.

## Features
- **Haar Cascade Classifier:** Uses a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for vehicle detection.
- **Real-time Detection:** Processes video frames in real-time to detect cars.
- **GUI for Video Selection:** Provides a simple GUI to select video files for processing.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Displays bounding boxes around detected vehicles in the video.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)
- numpy

You can install the required packages with pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless tk pillow numpy
```

### Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hassan23121999/Car-Detection-System.git
cd Car-Detection-System
```

## Usage
Run the script to detect cars in a video:
```bash
python Final_Car_detection_system.py
```
Follow these steps to use the car detection system:
1. Open the code file for the car detection system.
2. Run the script.
3. A user interface will pop up. Click "Pick Video File".
4. Select a video file from your computer.
5. The video screen will display with car detection markings.
